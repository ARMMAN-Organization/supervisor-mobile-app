# supervisor-mobile-app — Standard Development Workflow

> **SESSION BOOTSTRAP:** first read the workspace root `../CLAUDE.md` and
> `../docs/claude-context.md` for current project state. Design source =
> `../docs/project-docs/Arogya Sakhi - Revamp/` (per-section boards; **build to the
> CURRENT purple frames**, orange = superseded). Don't ask the user to re-explain
> context that lives there.

This file complements `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (architecture & code standards). The workflow below
is MANDATORY for every develop/modify/refactor request. Never skip a step. Never start coding
before Steps 2 AND 3 are explicitly approved by the user.

This app shares the Arogya Sakhi design system with `sakhi-mobile-app`. The theme
(`ui/theme/Color.kt`, `Dimens.kt`, `Type.kt`, `Shadows.kt`), fonts, and `ic_*`
drawables are kept in parity with the Sakhi app. When the shared design system changes,
update BOTH apps.

## Step 1 — Understand the requirement

- Read the full request carefully; be sure the objective is fully understood.
- If anything is unclear or ambiguous, ask simple, direct clarification questions.
- Do not make assumptions.

## Step 2 — Implementation plan (STOP: wait for approval)

Once the requirement is clear, provide a detailed plan covering:

- Objective of the change
- Overall approach
- Files to be created, modified, or removed
- Components, APIs, database, or services affected
- Edge cases and risks
- Expected output after implementation

Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

## Step 3 — Test cases (STOP: wait for approval)

After the plan is approved, write all functional test cases before any implementation:

- Positive, negative, and edge-case scenarios
- Validation and error-handling tests

Wait for explicit approval of the test cases before coding.

## Step 4 — Development

Only after test cases are approved:

- Implement the feature following the existing project architecture and coding standards
  (see `.claude/CLAUDE.md` code-review checklist).
- Keep code modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Avoid any changes outside the agreed scope unless explicitly instructed.

## Design-fidelity checklist (MANDATORY for every screen built from Figma)

Before delivering any UI, compare the implementation against the design export
element-by-element and confirm ALL of the following. "Roughly similar" is not done.

1. **Container hierarchy** — reproduce surfaces exactly: lavender background shows only
   where the design shows it; content below headers sits on the white rounded-top sheet
   (`Dimens.SheetRadius`); cards get their designed elevation/border.
2. **Row grouping & alignment** — elements the design puts on one row stay on one row,
   with the same alignment (e.g. name + action pill centered on a shared axis). Never let
   layout convenience change the design's grouping.
3. **Typography per element** — correct family AND size AND weight. Serif titles use
   `SerifTitle` (Libre Baskerville); KPI numbers use `KpiNumber`; measure sizes from the
   design export instead of guessing from existing tokens. New sizes become named tokens.
4. **Spacing & proportions** — paddings, tile heights, corner radii measured from the
   design (base-4 scale), added to `Dimens` — never inline.
5. **Self-diff before delivery** — render the design page crop at high resolution, walk
   the screen top-to-bottom listing every visual difference, and fix them BEFORE handing
   over. Known intentional deviations (e.g. placeholder icons) must be listed explicitly
   in the final summary.

## Design tokens (MANDATORY — the single source of truth for pixels & colors)

Every color, size, spacing and font in this app MUST come from these tokens
(`ui/theme/Color.kt`, `Dimens.kt`, `Type.kt`, `Shadows.kt`). Inline hex values or
`.dp`/`.sp` literals in screens/components are forbidden. If a design needs a value
that has no token, CREATE the token first, then use it — and keep this table updated.
These tables are shared with `sakhi-mobile-app`; keep the two in sync.

### Colors (`Color.kt`)

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `Primary` | #7C4DFF | brand lavender: buttons, active tabs, links |
| `BackgroundLavender` | #F1EDF9 | screen background behind headers |
| `PrimarySurface` | #EDE7FB | selected chips, highlight badges ("N days remaining") |
| `RiskHigh` / error | #D32F2F | high risk, error states |
| `RiskModerate` | #F57C00 | moderate risk |
| `RiskMild` / warning | #FBC02D | mild risk (dark text on it) |
| `RiskLow` / `StatusSuccess` | #2E7D32 | low risk, success |
| `StatusSuccessSurface` | #F1F8F2 | success banner background |
| Information | #1D79E5 | info banners (add token when first used) |
| `NeutralG10` | #F7F9FC | avatar/light surfaces |
| `NeutralG50` | #E6E6E6 | hairline borders, dividers |
| `NeutralG75` | #B3B3B3 | input borders |
| `NeutralG100` | #999999 | placeholders |
| `NeutralG200` | #656565 | secondary text, captions |
| `NeutralG400` | #333333 | primary text |
| `White` | #FFFFFF | sheets, cards |
| `ShadowTint` | #26000000 | ONLY via `Modifier.softShadow()` |

### Typography (`Type.kt`) — Cabin (UI) + Libre Baskerville (select titles)

| Token | Font/Weight/Size | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `SerifTitleLarge` | Baskerville Bold 24 | page titles ("My Beneficiaries") |
| `SerifTitle` | Baskerville Bold 18 | card/section titles |
| `KpiNumber` | Cabin Bold 40 | dashboard stat numbers |
| `headlineLarge` | Cabin Bold 32 | H2 KPI |
| `headlineMedium` | Cabin Bold 28 | screen titles (Login) |
| `headlineSmall` | Cabin Bold 24 | prominent names |
| `titleLarge` | Cabin Bold 18 | H4, card names |
| `titleMedium` | Cabin SemiBold 16 | tabs, chips, Body 1 |
| `bodyLarge` | Cabin Regular 16 | body copy |
| `bodyMedium` | Cabin Regular 14 | meta text |
| `labelLarge` | Cabin SemiBold 14 | badges, field labels |
| `labelMedium` | Cabin Medium 14 | small buttons |
| `labelSmall` | Cabin Regular 12 | captions, dates |

### Spacing & sizes (`Dimens.kt`) — base-4 scale: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24

`ScreenPadding` 24 · `ItemSpacing` 16 · `ChipSpacing` 12 · `SmallSpacing` 8 ·
`ButtonHeight` 48 · `SmallButtonHeight` 44 · `SearchBarHeight` 52 · `ChipHeight` 40 ·
`AvatarSize` 44 · `SheetRadius` 40 (top of content sheets) · `CardRadius` 16 ·
`TileRadius` 12 · `TilePadding` 20 · `CardAccentHeight` 6 · `TabIndicatorHeight` 4 ·
`PillButtonPaddingH` 16 (compact pill content padding) ·
`TabletMinWidthDp` 600 (tablet layout breakpoint — the ONLY device check allowed)

### Icons

Design icons live as VectorDrawables in `res/drawable/ic_*.xml` (converted from
Figma SVG exports; sources in `../design/icons/`) and are kept in parity with the
Sakhi app. ALWAYS prefer `ic_*` drawables via `painterResource` over Material
`Icons.*` — Material icons are placeholders only when no design icon exists. Custom
vectors the Material set lacks live in `ui/components/AppIcons.kt`. Key mappings:
calendar `ic_calendar_blank`/`ic_calendar_dots` · referral `ic_referral` · mother
`ic_woman` · infant `ic_baby` · visit/ANC `ic_anc` · location `ic_location` · phone
`ic_phone_call` · arrows `ic_arrow_left`/`ic_arrow_right` · plus `ic_plus` · mic
`ic_microphone` · search `ic_magnifying_glass` · filter `ic_funnel_simple` · close
`ic_x` · check `ic_check`/`ic_check_circle` · warning `ic_warning`/`ic_warning_circle`.

### Effects

Box shadows: ONLY `Modifier.softShadow(cornerRadius)` from `Shadows.kt`
(20dp blur, 4dp y-offset, `ShadowTint`). Never `Modifier.shadow`/Material elevation.

## Form factors — TABLET FIRST, ZERO COMPROMISE ON EITHER

The Supervisor app targets tablets as the priority device AND phones. Priority sets the
build/verify ORDER — it is NOT a quality tradeoff: both form factors must match their
respective Figma designs pixel-close. A screen is not "done" until BOTH pass. For EVERY
screen:

1. Build and verify the **tablet layout first**, then the mobile layout — both to
   full design fidelity.
2. Adaptive layout, never a stretched phone UI on tablet (e.g. wider modal and multi-
   column content on tablet vs single-column on mobile per the style guide).
3. Extract and measure BOTH the tablet and mobile frames from the Figma boards before
   planning a screen.
4. The user sends TWO QA screenshots per screen (tablet + mobile); collect deltas
   from both into one batched fix round.
5. Use `WindowSizeClass` (or width breakpoints as tokens in `Dimens`) to switch
   layouts — no hardcoded device checks.

## UI verification loop (MANDATORY for every screen)

Root causes of past rework: eyeballing low-res exports, mapping to nearest existing token
instead of measuring, and trusting platform defaults to match Figma. Therefore:

1. **Measure, never eyeball.** Before coding, render the design page at high resolution
   (150dpi+) and derive px values for font sizes, paddings, radii, icon sizes, element
   heights. Nearest-existing-token mapping is forbidden; if a measured value has no
   token, create one.
2. **Ask for Dev Mode specs first.** If the user can provide Figma Dev Mode values
   (typography, spacing, effects/shadows) for the screen, request them at Step 1 —
   exact specs eliminate measurement error entirely.
3. **Distrust platform defaults.** Known traps: Material elevation ≠ Figma box-shadow
   (use `Modifier.softShadow` from `ui/theme/Shadows.kt`); default Button height ≠
   design pill height (set `Dimens.ButtonHeight`); system font ≠ brand fonts (use
   `CabinFamily`/`SerifTitle` tokens). When a design effect depends on rendering, state
   how it was implemented and why in the summary.
4. **One visual QA round is part of the workflow.** The agent cannot screenshot the
   running app, so after delivery, ask the user for ONE device screenshot per screen and
   fix all reported deltas in a single batch — not one message per fix. Collect every
   difference before editing.
5. **Alignment intent, not just placement.** For every row/group, replicate the design's
   alignment axis (e.g. label centered to a button's height, caption centered under its
   pill). When composing, state the intended axis in a code comment so review can catch
   drift.

## Step 5 — Final summary

After development is complete, provide:

- List of files changed
- Summary of the implementation
- Any assumptions made
- Commands required to run or test the changes (`./gradlew detekt :app:testDebugUnitTest`)
- Follow-up improvements or known limitations
